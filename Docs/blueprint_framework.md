## What is an OPI Blueprint (Intent and Goals)?

An OPI Blueprint is an example architecture that shows how to
operationalize an open-source component within the OPI ecosystem. Rather
than presenting raw code, APIs, or RFC specifications, a Blueprint takes an
OPI-supported technology and demonstrates a practical, real-world
deployment pattern that an enterprise customer or systems integrator could
replicate.

**The intent is to:**

* **Accelerate adoption** by bridging the gap between OPI’s open-source
  projects and production-ready deployments.  Customers don’t buy RFC
  adoption—they buy outcomes.
* **Showcase the value of DPU/IPU technology** in offloading complex
  networking, security, and storage functions to dedicated hardware,
  freeing host CPU cores for higher-value workloads.
* **Drive services engagement** by pairing the Blueprint with the
  integrator or partner who built it, so that enterprises interested in
  deploying the solution have a clear path to professional services,
  support, and hardware procurement.
* **Strengthen the OPI vendor ecosystem** by demonstrating multi-vendor
  interoperability across hardware (Dell, Intel, Marvell), software (F5
  BIG-IP Next, NGINX, Red Hat OpenShift), and infrastructure automation
  (Terraform, Ansible).

## What constitutes a Blueprint (Deliverables)?

A complete Blueprint should include the following deliverables:

* **Reference Architecture Diagram** – A visual topology showing the
  hardware, software, and network components and how they interconnect.
  This should be understandable by a solutions architect or IT
  decision-maker, not just a developer.
* **Bill of Materials (BOM)** – A list of validated hardware (e.g., Dell
  chassis, Intel IPU E2100), software versions (e.g., RHEL 9.x, BIG-IP Next
  for K8s), and any licensing requirements.
* **Deployment Guide** – Step-by-step documentation covering installation,
  configuration, and validation. Should include infrastructure-as-code
  artifacts (Terraform modules, Ansible playbooks, Helm charts, YAML
  manifests) where applicable.
* **Use Case Narrative** – A description of the business problem the
  Blueprint solves, the target persona (e.g., network architect, platform
  engineer, CISO), and why IPU/DPU offload matters for this workload.
* **Validation/Test Results** – Evidence that the Blueprint works as
  documented. This could include performance benchmarks, screenshots, or
  recorded walkthroughs.
* **Partner/Integrator Attribution** – Clear branding and contact
  information for the contributing partner(s), so that end-customers who
  want to deploy the solution know exactly who built it and who can help
  them operationalize it in their environment.

## How is it different from a Technical Demo?

A Technical Demo proves that a technology works. A Blueprint shows how to
put it into production.

| **Dimension** | **Technical Demo** | **Blueprint** |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| **Audience** | Developers, project contributors | Solutions architects, IT decision-makers, enterprise customers |
| **Purpose** | Validate that the OPI API/framework functions correctly on target hardware | Show a complete, deployable solution pattern with real-world applicability |
| **Scope** | Single feature or integration point (e.g., NGINX proxy on a Marvell OCTEON DPU) | End-to-end architecture including HW, OS, orchestration, networking, and application layers |
| **Depth** | Often tied to RFCs, API specs, and low-level implementation details | Focused on operational readiness: how to deploy, manage, and scale **Output** Working proof-of-concept, often ephemeral or lab-only Documented reference architecture with IaC artifacts, BOM, and deployment guide |
| **Reusability** | Limited – typically requires deep OPI expertise to reproduce | High – designed so an integrator or customer can replicate independently |
| **Branding** | OPI project branding only | OPI \+ contributing partner branding (e.g., WorldTech IT, Dell, Red Hat) |

*In short: Technical Demos live in the world of development and validation.
Blueprints live in the world of adoption and services. The Demo answers
“does it work?” The Blueprint answers “how do I deploy this at my
company?”*

## How do Blueprints tie-in to OPI?

Blueprints are the adoption arm of the OPI Project. The OPI Project’s core
mission is to create a vendor-neutral, open-source framework of APIs and
tools for managing IPUs and DPUs. That work produces standardized
interfaces, reference implementations, and tested integrations—but it
doesn’t inherently show an enterprise customer how to operationalize those
components. Blueprints close that gap by:

* **Consuming OPI APIs and tools** in validated, end-to-end architectures
  that prove multi-vendor interoperability.
* **Providing the “last mile”** between OPI’s open-source projects
  (opi-api, sztp, DPU Operator) and what a customer actually needs to stand
  up in their data center.
* **Creating a feedback loop** where real-world deployment patterns surface
  gaps or enhancements needed in the OPI framework itself (e.g., the recent
  TSC discussion around a supportability audit and DPU/IPU hardware status
  matrix).
* **Engaging OPI member vendor ecosystems** (Dell, Intel, Red Hat, F5,
  Marvell) by demonstrating their products working together under the OPI
  umbrella, which strengthens the business case for continued investment in
  the project.

## I have a Blueprint Idea, what should I do next?

Great—here’s the recommended process:

* **Draft a one-pager.** Describe the use case, target audience, which OPI
  components it exercises, the hardware/software stack, and who the
  contributing partner(s) would be. Keep it concise—this is a pitch, not a
  design doc.
* **Bring it to the TSC.** Present the one-pager during a TSC meeting. The
  TSC will evaluate whether it aligns with the project’s priorities,
  whether the required lab resources are available, and whether there are
  any overlaps with existing work.
* **Get resource alignment.** Confirm who is contributing engineering time,
  whether the OPI Lab has the necessary hardware provisioned (this has
  historically been a bottleneck), and agree on a realistic timeline with
  guard rails around time commitment.
* **Build, document, and validate.** Stand up the solution in the OPI Lab
  (or a contributing partner’s lab), capture all deliverables (architecture
  diagram, BOM, deployment guide, test results), and ensure
  branding/attribution is in place.
* **Publish and present.** Once validated, the Blueprint gets published to
  the OPI Lab/repository and can be showcased at events (OCP Global Summit,
  GTC, Red Hat Summit, etc.) and through OPI marketing channels. |

## How can end-customers benefit from the Blueprints?

End-customers benefit in several concrete ways:

* **Reduced time-to-value.** Instead of figuring out how to piece together
  IPU/DPU infrastructure from scratch, customers can start with a validated
  reference architecture and adapt it to their environment.
* **Vendor-neutral confidence.** Because Blueprints are built on OPI’s open
  standards, customers aren’t locked into a single vendor’s proprietary
  stack. They can swap components (e.g., different DPU hardware) while
  keeping the same deployment pattern.
* **Clear path to professional services.** Each Blueprint identifies the
  partner/integrator who built it. If a customer wants help deploying or
  customizing the solution, they know exactly who to call. This is
  especially valuable for enterprises that need a trusted integrator to
  handle complex IPU/DPU deployments.
* **TCO visibility.** The BOM and architecture diagram give customers a
  concrete understanding of what they need to procure and what the
  deployment footprint looks like, making it easier to build a business
  case internally.
* **De-risked evaluation.** Blueprints that are live in the OPI Lab can be
  demonstrated or even trialed, giving customers a way to see the solution
  working before committing budget.

## Where do these Blueprints reside? OPI Lab?

Blueprints have both a physical and digital home:

* **OPI Lab (Physical/Virtual).** The Linux Foundation-hosted OPI Lab is
  the primary environment where Blueprints are built and validated. This is
  where the actual hardware (IPUs, DPUs, servers) lives and where live
  demonstrations can be run. Contributing partners may also host
  complementary lab environments to accelerate development when OPI Lab
  provisioning timelines are a constraint.
* **OPI GitHub Repository (Digital).** All Blueprint documentation, IaC
  artifacts, deployment guides, and architecture diagrams should be
  published to the OPI project’s GitHub (e.g., under opi-poc or a dedicated
  blueprints repository). This ensures they are version-controlled,
  community-accessible, and can be maintained over time.
* **OPI Website / Marketing Channels.** High-level summaries and
  architecture diagrams should also be published to OPI’s public-facing
  channels so that potential adopters can discover them without digging
  through GitHub.

*The key principle: a Blueprint should be reproducible by anyone with the
right hardware and the published documentation. It should not require
access to a specific lab instance to understand or replicate.*

## Does OPI have a preference for one Blueprint over the other?

OPI does not mandate a ranked priority list, but there are practical
factors that make some Blueprints more strategically valuable than others:

* **Multi-vendor interoperability.** Blueprints that demonstrate OPI
  working across multiple member vendors’ hardware and software (e.g., Dell
  chassis \+ Intel IPU \+ F5 BIG-IP Next \+ Red Hat OpenShift) are highly
  valued because they reinforce OPI’s core value proposition of vendor
  neutrality.
* **Actively maintained components.** The TSC is currently working through
  a source audit and supportability assessment to understand which OPI
  components are actively maintained and on what hardware. Blueprints built
  on well-supported components with clear community or vendor backing will
  be prioritized.
* **Customer demand signal.** Blueprints that address use cases with known
  enterprise demand—such as zero-touch provisioning, multi-tenant isolation
  on IPU/DPU, or Kubernetes-native network function offload—will naturally
  get more traction and support.
* **Partner commitment.** A Blueprint with a committed contributing partner
  who will invest engineering time, maintain the documentation, and stand
  behind the solution as a services provider carries more weight than an
  idea without resourcing.

*Bottom line: the best Blueprint is one that solves a real customer
problem, uses actively maintained OPI components on validated hardware,
involves multiple OPI member vendors, and has a committed partner behind it
ready to support adoption.*
